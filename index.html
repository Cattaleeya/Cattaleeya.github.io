    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>
      <b>•	What is your interest in IT? When did you interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b><br>
      I have been interested in IT since I moved to work in Australia. During this time, I had to work closely with the Engineers Teams on the construction site in Karratha, Western Australia and two of my engineer colleagues showed me how to solve the IT problems/complications. For instance, as we worked in the remote area the internet connection wasn’t good enough, sometimes, and the network disappeared, so my friends showed me how to map the network drive. Besides, my former boss always upgraded his iPhone; however, he didn’t know how to connect to the company server so I would help with that. As a result, it was because of these scenarios that my interest in the IT field was generated. Furthermore, I have always been curious about the IT field on how it works, how they build the applications; and how coding is involved, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
      The reason why I chose to study with RMIT because they allow me to study online fulltime and not require the IELTS for non-native English background. Moreover, I did some research about the RMIT and it is the top Public university in Melbourne, Australia and ranked # 206 in the QS world university Rankings 2022 (ref. www.topuniversities.com). Therefore, considering your reputation, available courses; and couple with how conveniently I could enrol in the course, I decided to join RMIT very easily. Additionally, after chatting with student advisor I can complete two core subjects which is the introduction of Information Technology and Introduction of Programming, and I will then be able to enrol in the IT degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
      I am hoping that I could improve and enhance my knowledge and skills regarding IT in a much better levels so that I could apply with my future careers. Therefore, I expect a clear, precise, and on point information as to give me a better perspective and understanding in the IT field which will help to my skills and careers changes from Document Control to System Administrator and/or Information Management System Manager in the ten years times.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b><br>
      This position appealing to me because I like the idea of being a first point of contact when someone has a network problem, and I can resolve their problems. I also like the challenges in developing, installing, maintaining, and supporting the organization associated to database and software and monitoring company network performance and be able to implement of future systems and software, its motivated me more and keeping my brain sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b><br>
    To work as a System Administrator, firstly I need to gain a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology or Computer Science and building tech skills by having three to five years of experiences. Secondly, I must take extra course to become a system administrator. Thirdly, I need to develop outstanding communication, interpersonal, organization and leadership skills. Finally, I must understand about processes, systems, applications, infrastructure, cloud, storage, and other various technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b><br>
      I now have experiences in managing, establishing, and maintaining effective Document Control systems and processes for John Holland company and I have been using different EDMS software, systems, and database such as InEight (Teambinder), Oracle Aconex, Incite, SharePoint, ProjectWise, Nintex Workflow, BlueBeam, PowerBI; and IMS (Integrated Management System).  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.</b><br>
      I have been discussed with my manager about my career changes from Document Control towards a System Administrator and it sounds positive. Therefore, I need to get involve more during the process of developing new systems and software. For example, in the last couple months we need to include the NCRs (Non conformation reports) into SharePoint RFIs workflow, and we must test SharePoint workflow by using Nintex Form. However, I need to develop my IT knowledge by completing the IT degree and involve in any IT related in my role as much as I can.

      According to my personality test results, it indicates that I am a “Defender” who has introverted mind, observant energy; and feeling nature when dealing with decision making and coping with emotional. It seems I have a judging tactics when approaching to work, planning and decision-making and I am assertive that showing how confident I am in and ability to decide
      The result shows that I am a defender who is simply humble and modest in my own way and can be relied on all the time whether it is work/family problems because I always go extra miles to help those who needed help
    </p>
    <p>

        From my test results It tells me that I am flexible, open minded, assertive, listen to others and focus person therefore this can be influence to my team as a trustworthy person as they can depend on me.
     </p>
     <p>
       <b>•	How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
       Knowing that weaknesses for Defender personality type are humble, shy, very sensitive and too altruistic, yet reliable, enthusiastic, and hard-working (website references); therefore, I need to work things out to balance my strengths and weaknesses so it would help not only me but also my team to run smoothly and efficiently.

      <b>•	What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
      I am Visual learner which means that the best way to learn or remember new things/information is by sight, it should be presented in a solid visual format such as pictures, graphs, maps; and diagrams, something I can easily picture of when I close my eyes. Moreover, to help me visualise things even better is to highlight the main aspects of the information by using highlighter pens, writing in different font, making it bold or underlining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br> 
      Since I am good at visualising information, then I would use that as an advantage when working in a team, not only to helps others remember things easier but also to make an ideal visualisation for our group assessment which, I believe, will indeed benefit when presenting to the whole class.

I would be able to take opinions, ideas, and feedback, good or bad and be able to effectively make decisions based on facts and coordinated team data, with minimal emotive or negative influence.
