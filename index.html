    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>
      <b>•	What is your interest in IT? When did you interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b><br>
      I have been interested in IT since I moved to work in Australia. During this time, I had to work closely with the Engineers Teams on the construction site in Karratha, Western Australia and two of my engineer colleagues showed me how to solve the IT problems/complications. For instance, as we worked in the remote area the internet connection wasn’t good enough, sometimes, and the network disappeared, so my friends showed me how to map the network drive. Besides, my former boss always upgraded his iPhone; however, he didn’t know how to connect to the company server so I would help him with that. As a result, it was because of these scenarios that my interest in the IT field was generated. Furthermore, I have always been curious about the IT field on how it works, how they build the applications; and how coding is involved, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
      The reason why I chose to study with RMIT is that they allow me to study online fulltime and do not require the IELTS for non-native English background. Moreover, I did some research about the RMIT and it is the top Public university in Melbourne, Australia and ranked # 206 in the QS world university Rankings 2022 (RMIT 2021). Therefore, considering your reputation, available courses; and couple with how conveniently I could enrol in the course, I decided to join RMIT very easily. Additionally, after chatting with student advisor, I can complete two core subjects which is the introduction of Information Technology and Introduction of Programming, and I will then be able to enrol in the IT degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
      I am hoping that I could improve my knowledge and skills regarding IT at a much better levels so that I could apply them to my future careers. Therefore, I expect clear, precise, and on point information as to give me a better perspective and understanding in the IT field, to enchance my skills and knowledge; and eventually to help me change my future careers path from Document Control to System Administrator and/or Information Management System Manager in the ten years times.

      <img src="/images/seek_add.png" >
    </p><br>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b><br>
      This position appealing to me because I like the idea of being a first point of contact when someone has a network problem, and I can resolve their problems. I also like the challenges in developing, installing, maintaining, and supporting the organization associated to database and software and monitoring company network performance and being able to implement future systems and software, its motivated me more and kept my brain sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b><br>
    To work as a System Administrator, firstly I need to gain a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology or Computer Science and building tech skills by having three to five years of experiences. Secondly, I must take extra course to become a system administrator. Thirdly, I need to develop outstanding communication, interpersonal, organization and leadership skills. Finally, I must understand about processes, systems, applications, infrastructure, cloud, storage, and other various technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b><br>
      I now have experiences in managing, establishing, and maintaining effective Document Control systems and processes for John Holland company and I have been using different EDMS software, systems, and database such as InEight (Teambinder), Oracle Aconex, Incite, SharePoint, ProjectWise, Nintex Workflow, BlueBeam, PowerBI; and IMS (Integrated Management System).  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.</b><br>
      I have been discussed with my manager about my career changes from Document Control towards a System Administrator and it sounds positive. Therefore, I need to get involve more during the process of developing new systems and software. For example, in the last couple months we need to include the NCRs (Non-Conformation Reports) into the SharePoint RFIs workflow, and we must test SharePoint workflow by using Nintex Form. However, I need to develop my IT knowledge by completing the IT degree and involving in any IT related in my role as much as I can.

     <b>•	What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
      Based on How to study.com (2021), I am Visual learner which means that the best way to learn or remember new things/information is by sight, it should be presented in a solid visual format such as pictures, graphs, maps; and diagrams, something I can easily picture of when I close my eyes. Moreover, to help me visualise things even better is to highlight the main aspects of the information by using highlighter pens, writing in different font, making it bold or underlining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>•	How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br> 
      Since I am good at visualising information, then I would use that as an advantage when working in a team, not only to helps others remember things easier but also to make an ideal visualisation for our group assessment which, I believe, will indeed benefit when presenting to the whole class.

       <h2>Project Idea - Multi Station Indoor Plant Irrigation System </h2>    
    <hr>
    <p>
      <b>Overview </b><br>
      Nowadays, many people would love to have plants inside their house or apartment but there is always a problem at the same time as taking a holiday, leaving your plants at home unattended and worrying about regardless of whether they will still be alive when you get home. In this situation, you need an automatic irrigation channel (like outdoor systems) to individualise the plants watering requirement. Nevertheless, if you have different size plants that require varying amounts of water, creating multiple channels or vales is the best solution that I can offer for this IT project. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Motivation</b><br>
      During taking a holiday and nobody at home to watering your favourite plants and make you worry about whether they will still alive. Unless you have a neighbour who you can trust enough to let into your house, consequently once you return home, you frequently see your plants die and/or dehydrated. At this point you even try to change the new soil, change location, feed them more plant food, try to keep them alive and look healthy again. However, most of the time it is disappointing attempted, and in the end, your lovely, beautiful plants are still gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      There are several types of automatic indoor plants watering system in the market, but then they are only a single station, meaning one water line feeds all plants at the same time at the same rate. The problem with this is if you have different sized plants that require varying amounts of water. For instance, you have a large fern in a 30 cm pot and a small begonia in a 12 cm pot then one water line could provide either the correct amount of water for the fern whilst at the same time overwatering and probably overflowing the begonia or the right amount of water for the begonia and under watering the fern. In this situation, you need multiple channels or valves (like outdoor systems) to individualise the plants watering requirements; therefore, creating a multi-station indoor plant irrigation system is a great features for your indoor plants' solution. Setting up an irrigation system effectively is important to maintain healthy plants. It is important that you have evaluated your level of water, schedule depending on the maturity of your plants, their growing cycle, and the time of years. You can set up how many times a day for watering your plants, how much water your plants will need in different plants sized and you can monitor it elsewhere in the world via your smartphone, not just monitoring but also you can control the timer and water level by using Raspberry Pi application (Hallek 2020).
    </p>
    <p>
      In facts, in general all systems of automation have advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered when deciding which system will suit the irrigation layout for a particular property. No system will be the best system for all properties, so you need to write your code and let do not worry anything else except making sure you create it to serve your plants purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, if you are planning a vacation, love travel or need to go out somewhere with friends, colleagues and family but often forget to feed your plant. This is exactly the type of system that will keep your plants beautiful, healthy, and watered. You don’t need to ask a friend or neighbour. Unless you trust them enough to let into your house or apartment then there are only a few options available to you. Therefore, the Multi watering plants system is your perfect solution as the automatic watering system will take care of your lovely plants for you while you are away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tools and Technologies</b><br>
      DIY Drippers: Drip Irrigation for Hydroponics (2015) shows how to make multiple station indoor plants irrigation system, at least you need to have a minimum component to build this multi-system. The following elements that you can be used for this project are as below sample:
    <ul style="float: left; min-width: 400px; border-right: solid 1px;">
      <li>Electronic breadboard</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi module to be determined</li>
      <li>Python programming language</li>
      <li>Several Solenoid valves and relays</li>
      <li>Several moisture sensors</li>
      <li>Several electrical wiring</li>
      <li>Battery </li>
      <li>Switches</li>
      <li>LCDs display panel </li>
      <li>Water tanks</li>
      <li>Water tubing</li>
    </ul><img src="/images/rp.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px;height:300px;" />
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, if you want to be able to control and monitor your plants while you are on vacation anywhere in the world, then you should be considering installing a smart phone application which will be considered at the latest date smart phone application, controlling and monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Skill Required</b><br>
      To build this specific project, you need to have skills and knowledges of how to use Python software for programming and coding as well as some electronic engineering knowledge for the Raspberry Pi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Outcome</b><br>
      According to my research about the effectiveness of automated irrigation system is quite impressive, it’s reliable, efficient, and accurate. It always delivers the exact time and the amount of water when you need it as well as there is no chance of flooding your house while you are on holidays. Moreover, you do not need to ask for your friend or neighbour to take care of your lovely healthy indoor plants. Accordingly, the best part is that you don’t even need to be home when your plants need to be watered.
